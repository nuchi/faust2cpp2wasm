### Faust to C++ to wasm

A drop in replacement for the wasm file generated by `faust2wasm`, but with Faust's C++ backend instead of its wasm backend.

See [this issue](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/issues/717) for more details and motivation.

Usage:
```
PATH="/path/to/wasi-sdk/bin:$PATH" ./faust2cpp2wasm mydsp.dsp -o mydsp.wasm
```

The generated wasm file can be used in place of the output generated by `faust2wasm -worklet`.

Requires the [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) and [binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) to be in your PATH.

### To-do

I haven't added support for buttons/checkboxes yet.
